    <h1><strong>Humans vs. Machines: An AI Odyssey</strong></h1>

    By <strong><i>Christopher Watkins</strong></i><br>

    <br>March 10, 2016<br>

    <br><strong><i>***Breaking News: AlphaGo has won the first
            two matches!***</strong></i><i> In this, the third in our series on the epic Go matches being played<br> 
            between
        AlphaGo (Google’s
        Artificial Intelligence software) and Lee Se-Dol (Current Go World Champion), we look at the history of<br>
        Humans vs. Machines, and the innovations that have led us to this incredible moment in time.</i><br>

    For as long as humans have built things, we’ve wrestled with the implications of what we’ve built. In many cases,
    these philosophical and<br>
    
    ethical wrestlings have made for great drama—think Frankenstein, or 2001: A Space Odyssey. Often, the hypothetical
    scenarios we envision<br> 
    come remarkably close to true, and the discoveries we’ve made in the fields of Artificial
    Intelligence and Machine Learning make clear that a<br> 
    “computer with a mind of its own” is <strike>going to take over the world</strike> not such a fantastic thing to imagine any longer.<br>

    <h1><strong>The Triumph Of Deep Blue</strong></h1>

    Perhaps this is why we are so
    captivated by human vs. machine competitions, because the idea of being overcome by that which we’ve<br>
    created speaks to something very deep within our collective consciousness. When IBM’s Deep Blue faced off against Garry Kasparov1, the<br>
    event resulted in more than <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/ibm100/us/en/icons/deepblue/">three billion impressions</a> around the world, and when IBM’s later
    creation Watson challenged the champions on<br>
    Jeopardy, millions of viewers were glued to the proceedings.

    <h1><strong>DeepMind’s AlphaGo</strong></h1>

    Taking place right now, there is an event that, while not likely to scale the same media heights, may in
    fact have far greater implications<br>
    when it comes to the future of “intelligent” machines. On March 9, in Seoul,
    South Korea, a computing system know as AlphoGo (built by<br>
    researchers at DeepMind—a Google Artificial Intelligence
    lab) began <a
        href="http://venturebeat.com/2016/02/04/youtube-will-livestream-googles-ai-playing-go-superstar-lee-sedol-in-march/">a
        five-game match</a>
    against Lee Se-dol, one of the very best players in<br>
    the world at the ancient game of Go.<br>

    <br>
    Why is this so significant?<br>

    <br>
    Here is how the DeepMind team explained it in their paper <a
        href="http://airesearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/deepmind-mastering-go.pdf">Mastering the Game of Go with
        Deep Neural Networks and
        Tree Search:</a><br>

    <br><i>The game of Go has long been viewed as the most challenging of classic games for artificial intelligence due to
    its enormous search space<br>
    and the difficulty of evaluating board positions and moves.</i><br>

    <br>
    Put another way, winning at Go is a kind of Holy Grail
    for those who strive to create machines that can “think” on their own, because<br>
    success at this uniquely complex game
    seems to require something more than just skill, knowledge, and experience. It requires intuition.<br>
    Feel. Style. Characteristics we associate with humans, not with machines.
